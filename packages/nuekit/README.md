### What is Nue?
Nue is a web framework for UX developers. What used to take a separate designer, React engineer, and an absurd amount of JavaScript can now be done by a UX developer and a small amount of CSS.

[Learn how it works](https://nuejs.org/docs/)


### Who is it for?
Nue is designed for the following people:

1. **UX developers**: who natively jump between **Figma** and **CSS** without confusing [designer-developer handoff](//medium.com/design-warp/5-most-common-designer-developer-handoff-mishaps-ba96012be8a7) processes in the way.

2. **Beginner web developers**: who want to skip the [redundant frontend layers](//roadmap.sh/frontend) and start building websites quickly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Experienced JS developers**: frustrated with the absurd amount of layers in the [React stack](//roadmap.sh/react) and look for simpler ways to develop professional websites.

4. **Designers**: aiming to learn web development, but find the React/JavaScript ecosystem impossible to grasp


### Ultimate goal
Ultimately Nue will be a ridiculously simpler alternative to **Next.js**, **Gatsby**, and **Astro**
