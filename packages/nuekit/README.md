## What is Nue?

Nue is a Static Site Generator (SSG) built from scratch for faster tooling, cleaner codebases, and better results. **It makes things •fun• again**

[Why Nue?](https://nuejs.org/docs/)

[How it works](https://nuejs.org/docs/how-it-works.html)

## Who is Nue good for?

Nue is a great fit for:

1. **Beginner web developers**: Those looking to bypass [frontend redundancy](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and work directly with the Web Standard Model: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Experienced JavaScript developers**: Those frustrated with the overwhelming amount of abstractions in the [React stack](https://roadmap.sh/react) and seeking simpler ways to develop professional websites.

3. **Design-focused teams**: Those prioritizing user experience and design systems, leveraging modern CSS to create efficient, lightweight websites that enhance usability without the bloat of JS monoliths.

In short: if you’re looking to build beautiful and innovative websites with faster tooling and a simpler development model, **Nue is the right choice for you**.
