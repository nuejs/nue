CSS size details for the [comparison graphs](.#size-graphs)


## Tailwind sizes

[tailwind-table]

- The sizes calculated by grabbing the code from [Tailwind Play](//play.tailwindcss.com/) and minifying it with [Lightning CSS](//lightningcss.dev/)

- **DSL** refers to "domain specific language", which is the inline styling (utility classes + expressions) inside the class name attribute

You can see the size details by running `nue --production stats .css` on your project directory:

All files are minified with Lightning CSS
