CSS size details for the [comparison graphs](.#size-graphs)


## Tailwind sizes

[tailwind-table]

* The sizes calculated by grabbing the code from [Tailwind Play](//play.tailwindcss.com/) and minifying it with [Lightning CSS](//lightningcss.dev/)

* **DSL** refers to "domain specific language", which is the inline styling (utility classes + expressions) inside the class name attribute



## Nue sizes

### File list

[css-files]

You can see the size details by running `nue --production stats .css` on your project directory:

  small: /img/nue-stats.png
  large: /img/nue-stats-big.png
  width: 400

All files are minified with Lightning CSS
