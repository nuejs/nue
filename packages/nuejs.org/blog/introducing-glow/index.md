Today we're launching *Glow* — a new take on syntax highlighting:

[image.large]
  caption: 30+ languages colored. Click for a standalone view.

  small: /img/glow-og.png
  href: /glow-demo/


*Glow is different*: Rather than parsing language internals, Glow focuses purely on aesthetics and the visual style of your code.

*Glow is simple*: With just a few CSS variables, Glow adapts all languages to match your brand colors effortlessly.

*Glow is small*: Glow is significantly smaller than mainstream alternatives — around [5KB](//pkg-size.dev/nue-glow) compared to [5MB](//pkg-size.dev/shiki). It’s the most compact implementation available.

## Coloring voodoo

Be it **Haskell**, **TypeScript**, or **Zig**. **React**, **Vue** or **Svelte**. Whatever Turing-free **Markdown** artifact is mixed with another tightly coupled language-of-the-day oddity. And they will all glow:

[image.larger]
  small: /img/glow-light.png
  large: /img/glow-light-big.png
  href: /glow-demo/light.html
  caption: All the 30+ languages in light mode

Contrast this to grammar-aware highlighters like *Shiki*, where it's a large programming effort to add a new language to the mix. For example, the [golang.json][go] grammar file has 2700 lines, and [javascript.json][js] is a whopping 6000-line configuration file.

[js]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/grammars/javascript.json

[go]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/grammars/go.json


## Easy brand coloring

If you look at the most recognizable brands on the internet, you'll notice that 80% of them are based on a single [brand color](//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-colors). It is often coupled with a secondary color and a complementary accent color. This is exactly how Glow works. You can make the code blocks compatible with your brand just by adjusting a handful of CSS variables:

```css.blue
/* brand-aware CSS variables*/
:root {
  --glow-primary-color: #7dd3fc;
  --glow-secondary-color: #4f72b6;
  --glow-accent-color: #419fff;
}
```

It's a no-brainer to create new themes, both light and dark, after which all languages will automatically adapt your brand colors. No missing color tokens, no surprises.

Contrast this to grammar-aware theming systems, like Shiki and *Prism*, where a single theme can have hundreds of color variables. [Monokai theme][monokai], for example, has 140 color variables, and [Material theme][material] has a whopping 296 variables. It's a huge development effort to build a new theme that works reliably across languages.

[monokai]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-themes/themes/monokai.json

[material]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-themes/themes/material-theme.json


## Unlimited possibilities

Glow's unique, [classless design system](/docs/syntax-highlighting.html) gives you line numbers, selections, error highlights, insertions, deletions, and much, much more.

``` .gradient.sky numbered
<script>
  // imports
  import { longpress } from './longpress.js';

  let pressed = false;
  ••bet glow_market = 9999_99++••;
</script>

<label>
  <input type=range •bind:value={duration}• max={2000} step={100}>
  {duration}ms
</label>

<button use:longpress={duration}
-  on:mousedown="{() => pressed = true}"
+  on:longpress="{() => pressed = true}">Press me</button>

<!-- condition -->
{#if pressed}
  <p>••Yoou•• pressed and held for {duration}ms</p>
{/if}

<style>
  /* button style */
  [role="button"], •button• {
    background-color: var(--main-color);
    color: #899;
  }
</style>
```


And when I say "unlimited", it means that:

``` md.live-code numbered
# There's something about Lightning CSS
Writing future CSS today has been a massive
•productivity boost.• You'll get nesting, `color-mix()`,
variables, and whatnot. Natively, today.

```


## Using together with Nue

[Nue](/) is a web framework specializing on UX development. As of today, it has built-in support for Glow. You can easily extend your Markdown with stacks of code blocks or tabbed code panels. For example:


[.codestack.larger]

  ### Content *YAML*

  ``` md
  # View metadata
  members:
    title: Members
    columns: [Source, Joined]
    sorting:
      created: Join date
      cc: Location
      email: Email

  customers:
    title: Customers
    columns: [Plan, Subscribed]
    sorting:
      created: Date subscribed
      card: Card type
  ```

  ### Styling *CSS*

  ``` css
  /* Tab styling */
  [role=tablist] {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .7);
    background-size: 3.5em;
    padding: .7em 1.3em 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;

    a {
      color: #fff9;
      padding: .2em 1em .4em;
      font-size: 90%;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  }
  ```


## Get started with Glow

You can try Glow either as a standalone library or together with the Nue framework.

### Standalone library

Install [nue-glow](//github.com/nuejs/nue/tree/master/packages/glow) with npm, pnpm, or bun:

```sh
npm i nue-glow
```

And follow the [Glow documentation](/docs/syntax-highlighting.html)


### With Nue

Try Glow with Nue as follows:

```sh
# Install Bun (if not done yet)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install website generator (Nuemark playground)
bun install nuekit --global

# Start a Nue project with a Glow-powered template
nue create simple-blog
```

Now you can enjoy goodies content hot-reloading when the code blocks are edited:
