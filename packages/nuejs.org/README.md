## A new website

A complete rewrite of everything:


### New documentation
To clearly explain the content-first development model, global design system, content management system, and the reactivity model for building both content-heavy multi page applications and single-page applications.


### New front page
To highlight the benefits of the content-first development model. Also works as a perfect example of the power of Nuemark and how even the more complex pages can be expressed with content-only text format.

### Blogging area
The content is the same, but everything was converted to work with the public Nue binary. The current website only works with a private Nue version.

### New design
To showcase the power of the global design system, CSS framework, and CSS best practices.

### Running locally
This website works with the dev-branch of Nue. Just clone the repository and run `nue` and the site should work on port 8080.

### Work in progress
The website is very much in progress. Still tons of work under the documentation area. The layout, CSS, and JS structure is likely going to change, but it's already pretty nice, clear, and minimalistic.

Estimated release is on July (2024). Nue itself is mostly fine-tuning and bug fixing. Once released, the version number will be `Nue 1.0 alpha`.
