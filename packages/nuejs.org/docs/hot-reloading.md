# Universal hot-reloading
Nue provides a powerful hot-reloading utility that automatically updates your browser as you edit your content, styling, layout, data files or reactive components:

## Updatable assets
Hot-reloading is automatically enabled in development. The client-server communication is based on server-sent events. Instead of making a full reload, Nue uses a technique called *DOM diffing* to only update the parts of the page that have changed. Here are the details of what gets automatically updated:


### Content
- Markdown content
- Front matter (Example: document.title updates)
- Layout files: Both root- and app-level `layout.html`
- `site.yaml` or application-specific YAML data (Example: Master navigation updates)
- Updates to other than the active page routes automatically to the new page

### Styling
- CSS file updates
- Inline styling changes
- New CSS files & CSS file removals
- Complete theme change via changes in the `globals: []` array in `site.yaml`

### Reactive components
- All component updates
- Form components: Potential form data is restored to the updated component
- Dialog components: Dialogs and overlays remain open after they update

## Non-goals
Nue hot-reloading applies to UI components only so updates to JavaScript/TypeScript extensions have no impact. These extensions are best developed and tested on the server side. The same goes to Web Components â€” the browser does not have the means to re-hydrate updated components.


## Disable hot-reloading
You can disable hot-reloading with the `hotreload: false` configuration option. Hot-reloading is automatically disabled for the production build, as it makes no sense there.
