# Markdown extensions
Markdown extensions or "tags" allow content authors to create rich, interactive web pages. This is a list of all tags and their configuration options.


## Tag usage
Tags are easy to read and write. They always start on a new line, with a square bracket, followed with a tag name and options. Let’s say we want to add a video, we would write something like this:

``` md
[video /videos/explainer.mp4]
```



### Supplying options
Tag options can be supplied in several ways:


``` md
// named options
[image •src•="hello.png" •caption•="Hello, World" •alt•="Hello image"]

// nested options
[image]
|  caption: Hello, World!
|  large: hello-big.png
|  small: hello.png
|  alt: Hello Image

// plain value without the attribute name
[image •hello.png•]

// handy syntax for id and class attributes
[image•#hero-image.heroic• hero.webp]
```

### Nested content
Most tags like images, buttons, tabs, and grids accept nested content:

``` md
[image explainer.png]
| This nested content is the caption for the image.
| You can add Markdown here like *emphasis* and `inline code`
```




## Tag reference

### Image
Renders an image with optional caption. For example:

``` md
[image hello.webp]
| This content here is the caption. Markdown *formatting* is supported
```

Shortcut alias (!) is supported:

``` md
[! hello.webp]
```

Images can link to URL's with `href` attribute:

``` md
[image book.svg href="/docs/" caption="View documentation"]
```

[Art direction](//web.dev/articles/codelab-art-direction) is supported:

``` md
[image small="ui-tall.png" large="ui-wide.png" ]
```

[Responsive images](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) are supported

``` md
[image.heroic]
  srcset: planet.png 450w, planet-big.png 900w
  sizes: (max-width: 600px) 450px, 900px
  alt: This is the alt text
  loading: eager
```

[.options]
  #### [image] options

  `alt` is an alternate text for the image

  `src` image source

  `caption` image caption

  `srcset` defines a set of responsive images for the browser to choose from

  `sizes` defines screen widths to indicate what image size would be best to choose from the srcset.

  `large` the large version of the image. the large image can have a different aspect ratio than the small one, which is the difference between art direction and responsitivity.

  `small` the small version of the image

  `offset` the screen size when small turns to large. The default value is 750 (px).

  `width` the image width




### Button
Renders a button:

``` md
