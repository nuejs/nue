# Nue FAQ

## Frequently asked questions

### Who are you?
I'm [Tero Piirainen](//x.com/tipiirai), a JavaScript and UX developer from **Helsinki**. I've been around for 25+ years founding startups and creating open-source projects. I'm known for [Riot.js](//riot.js.org/), **Flowplayer**, and **jQuery Tools**. Right now I'm focusing solely on Nue, which is by far the most ambitious project I've started.

### Why start all this?
Because the current [frontend stack](//roadmap.sh/frontend) has too many redundant layers. We need a simpler way to build websites and single-page applications, and we must bring UX development back to the forefront.


### Who is this a good fit?
Nue is a good fit for the following people:


1. **UX developers**: who wants to freely jump between **Figma** and **CSS** without a confusing [designer-developer handoff](//medium.com/design-warp/5-most-common-designer-developer-handoff-mishaps-ba96012be8a7) process in the way.

2. **Beginner web developers**: who want to skip the [redundant frontend layers](//roadmap.sh/frontend) and start building websites quickly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Experienced JS developers**: frustrated with the absurd amount of layers in the [React stack](//roadmap.sh/react) and looking for simpler ways to develop professional websites.

4. **Designers**: aiming to learn web development, but find the React/JavaScript ecosystem impossible to grasp



### Who is this a bad fit?
Nue is a bad fit for React developers who prefer to use TypeScript for styling and are not interested in learning modern, standards-based CSS.




### What is the ultimate goal?
The ultimate goal of Nue is to build [a perfect web framework](/blog/perfect-web-framework/) for UX developers. A simpler alternative to **Next.js**, **Vercel** and **Netlify**.


### Isn't this just another web framework?
On the contrary. Nue is currently the *only* framework for UX developers.

### How to migrate a large JavaScript codebase to Nue?
By converting your inline styling to semantic HTML, switching from JavaScript to CSS, and by assembling your content with the extended Markdown syntax. It's likely a full rewrite, but you are rewarded with a significantly cleaner, easier-to-maintain, and more performant product.


### What are the risks if Nue goes out of existence?
The code you'll write is semantic HTML/CSS, progressively enhanced with JavaScript. That's how the web works. It's a universal way to build websites. You'll invest in skills that benefit you for years to come. There will always be a platform that understands standards.


### Any plans to profit?
Yes. With pixel-perfect, easy-to-use templates for individuals, businesses, and design agencies. The well-organized and commented CSS code contains decades of experience and tons of useful tricks.


### Who are your inspirations?

- **Steve Jobs**. The greatest UX developer ever existed.

- **Mies van der Rohe**. His philosophy; "Less is more" defines my thinking.

- **Jarred Sumner** for [Bun](//bun.sh). It showcases the power of dreaming big.

- **Salvatore Sanfilippo** for the inspirational [coding style](//github.com/redis/redis/tree/unstable/src).


### Where does the word "Nue" come from?
"Nue" comes from the German word "neu", which translates to "new" in English. It is pronounced like `/nju/`.
