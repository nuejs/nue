    text: I love the vision behind this project!!! As a former front end dev who turned away from dev work due to a dislike for working entirely in JS I can see what I loved about UX dev work throughout the vision and roadmap of this project.

    text: Love what you are doing with the project, thank you! I also have a big passion for making the web a simpler place for developers. I work as a front-end developer by day, using React, and I've thought over and over again, surely there must be a better, simpler way. So thank you!

    text: Wow. I am so much loving the concepts you guys have introduced in Nue CSS and Nue Kit and all your projects are amazing. I am really falling in love with all of the projects.

    text: I just found your site, and am excited about the concepts of content first, separation of concern, and everything else. I have been looking and waiting for the RAD version of web development. Maybe Nue is it? Also, as a fellow Scandinavian, Finnish design doesn't hurt. Good luck forward!

    text: It's really awesome to see this recent counter-revolution of developer tools emphasizing simplicity. Nue gives me the same optimistic, feel-good vibe that htmx and Alpine.js gave me when I first read about them.

    text: I am very impressed by the examples, they are so easy to read. I have zero experience with React, Svelte and JS in general, but after reading the examples make me want to learn more.

    text: I'm really rooting for your project to grow. I'm very excited about its concept. Because I think no framework has it figured out yet, so I really welcome every new solution to make web dev easier.

    text: It's so wonderful to hear someone espouse the benefits of semantic CSS over all of this "utility-first" nonsense. I understand the draw of Tailwind but there's just so much overhead and the learning curve is steep. And if you're working with Tailwind all of the time, you'll forget what items-center means in CSS. Excited to follow Nue!

    text: It's funny how React and other frameworks spent so much effort abstracting the render loop, meanwhile Nue is just like "call update()". And in the end, Nue looks a lot simpler to use.
