# Nue JS
Nue JS is a tiny (2.3kb minzipped) JavaScript library for building web interfaces. It is the layout engine for [Nue web framework](https://nuejs.org) providing both server-side templating and client-side reactive islands.


## HTML microlibrary for UX developers
Nue template syntax is designed for [UX developers](https://nuejs.org/docs/) who prefer to write user interfaces with clean, semantic HTML instead of JavaScript. Think Nue as standard HTML, that you can extend with custom HTML-based components. These components help you build modern web applications in a simple, declarative way. For example:


```html
<div class="{ type }">
  <img src="{ img }">
  <aside>
    <h3>{ title }</h3>
    <p :if="desc">{ desc }</p>
    <slot/>
  </aside>
</div>
```

If React is "Just JavaScript", then Nue is "Just HTML" because any valid HTML is also valid Nue.
